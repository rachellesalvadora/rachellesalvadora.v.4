            <p>I have been through ups and down. Ins and outs. changed one path to another. Made mistakes and stupid decisions. But here I am now. Holding my head up high. Giving my best to change it and give my self another chance. Or i like to believe this is my last. I always say "okay I will try." This time, I say "I'll give my best shot."</p>

            <p>This will hold my random thoughts. Random realizations and learnings. About everything and anything I think of.<br/>What makes you wanna read it? What makes you wanna keep searching? <br/>I am just a girl. Just a girl who loves to wander and explore. i'm always curious about things. I can't say i wanna share it. But I want to write it. Because writing makes my brain growing. Idon't know why you are here or why aare you reading this. maybe you just have lots of time to waste in your hand. Since you have the time to waste on random things, I might help you out on finding some knowledge, articles, videos or things thats worth of your time.  I will write something on the videos, books, articles that i find interesting. <br />Keep reading. Keep scrolling down but since this is my blog. Please dont expect it to be subjective. Mostly of whats in here are MY opinions, MY thoughts, MY reviews, and MY point of view.</p>
